# Payroll-System
This folder contains all relevant files to the payroll system. 
The purpose of this project is to simulate a simple data entry system, which saves the data by writing out to a file. 
The program prompts the user input, creates data objects to hold the input, and writes to a file to "save" the data.

payroll.java is the main file
